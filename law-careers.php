        <h4>Careers in <strong>Law</strong> </h4>
      </div>
      <p>Law isn't just about being a solicitor or barrister. There's a huge range of other career options available within the industry. Other lesser known types of lawyers have many of the same responsibilities that solicitors and barristers have. For instance, solicitor advocates have the same rights of audience as barristers, and there's a great amount of overlap between the roles of a legal executive and a solicitor.</p>
      <p>Not only law firms, but business administration's around the globe always require executives with a law background among the policymakers. A law graduate can climb to the top of a corporate body and protect it from the legal onslaughts, frauds and bankruptcy using his/her knowledge. There's also a huge range of professions available within the legal sector that you may not have considered before, such as being a paralegal, a reporter, a member of a law firm's marketing team, a PR professional or an administrator.</p>
      <p>Careers in the legal sector are well-paid, well-respected and exciting. The rewards can be great, but the hours can be long and it requires many years of sustained effort to get where you want to be. But if you are up for the challenge, it's definitely worth exploring this sector in a little bit more detail. Whether you head off to university or you want to get stuck in straight after secondary school, you will certainly find something that suits you.</p>
