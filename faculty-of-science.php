								<strong>The Faculty of Science </strong>offers various undergraduate, postgraduate and doctoral programmes in different areas of Natural Sciences to emphasize on a close interaction between students and teachers for knowledge dissemination.

							</p>

							<p>
								The postgraduate students are encouraged to participate in research activities for which we have collaboration with specific industries and research organizations.
The Faculty of Science is unique from other institutions of higher learning as it is committed to imparting knowledge in pure sciences, which not only forms the foundation for further academic pursuits in science and technology but also acts as the foundation for students to pursue a career in research and higher-level teaching.
The academic programme is designed to meet the requirement of the latest technological developments and envisages to become a state-of-the-art department providing high-quality education and cutting-edge interdisciplinary research in science. A student-centric choice-based credit system (CBCS) is implemented, as recommended by the UGC to ease the access of students to the curriculum that fits to their own interest. All departments of the FoS has well-equipped laboratories to support practical experiments in respective branches of science. The Faculty is continuously associated with academic/sponsored research and industrial consultancy work.

							</p>

							<p>
								All the departments of the Faculty of science offers traditional undergraduate B.Sc. (Hons. ) programme and a postgraduate M.Sc. programmes in their respective disciplines.
