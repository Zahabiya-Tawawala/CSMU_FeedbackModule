      <p>Bachelors in Social Work are a step closer to obtaining a Master's degree, which enables one to provide clinical services such as psychotherapies. However, many bachelor's level social workers decide to work in entry level in direct care positions, providing services and assistance to people in need. They can work in different areas ranging from child and family to substance abuse counselors.</p>
