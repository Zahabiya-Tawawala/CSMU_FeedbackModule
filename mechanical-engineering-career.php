	  <p> Prospects for mechanical engineers are in numerous domains and they are known as the engineers with the most all-round skills. This is due to the diverse course curriculum mechanical engineer goes through; from software to workshop, from management desk to the machine design studio, they possess the skill set that no other engineering discipline can offer.. They will be best for those with training in the latest software tools, particularly for computational design and simulation. Such tools allow engineers and designers to take a project from the conceptual phase directly to a finished product, eliminating the need for prototypes.</p>
	  <p>Mechanical engineering students, who can learn to create virtual simulations before proceeding to the design, build, and test stages might find themselves in high demand by companies because these skills will allow firms to reduce product development cycles.</p>
	  <p>Emerging technical fields such as 3-D printing, robotics, drone designing etcare the necessities of the industries of tomorrow and skilled Mechanical Engineering students may find themselves as the ones reshaping the world.</p>
