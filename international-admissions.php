        	<p>Studying abroad is likely to be an exciting, enriching and fulfilling experience. But initially at least, it may also feel daunting and at times overwhelming. New international students have to adapt to a new place, new culture and perhaps a new language, all at the same time. We know how difficult it is to leave home and come to a foreign land- keeping this in mind we at CSMU provide special services to our international students in both our conveyance and accommodation departments. In order to attract talented students Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj University offers generous scholarships to meritorious students.</p>
